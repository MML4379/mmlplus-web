# MML+ Web
The open source code for MML+ APIs/libraries

# How would I use this?
You can't edit anything to get you free MML+ Premium, because that is stored in a server but to add menus and othersuch, developers can reference from this code.

# Why can't I get free MML+ Premium from this repository?
It is stored in a MML+ server. The code in the server is closed-source unlike the rest, so you can't change it to get free MML+

# Can I use it commercially?
Yes! The Apache 2.0 Licence allows you to modify and distribute it, but you can't call it your own.

# What is MML+ even used for?
As of 11/5/2022, the project is in PRE-ALPHA 1. It isn't intended for use by the public, but it is possible. MML+ is the open-source platform for everyone! You can stream video, play games, ect. Keep in mind that MML+ does not have all of its features implemented yet.

# What was the first MML+ Project?
Thanks for asking! It was actually MML Games! You can visit it [here](https://mmlgames.w3spaces.com).
